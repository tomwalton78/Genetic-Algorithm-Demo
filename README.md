# Genetic-Algorithm-Demo
Particle on a track uses a genetic algorithm to reach the end goal, 'learning' which moves to make to complete the track.

Setup instuctions:
1. Install these Python3 modules: pygame, opencv
2. Using the main.py file: set run_mode to 'train' to start with 0 knowledge, choose particle_size (must be a valid particle in the particles folder), select track_num (must be created (including sections) in the tracks folder).
To show previously trained particle and track combinations, that have reached the end of the track, set run_mode to 'show'.
